            No one can deny that the public school systems in Florida are in dire                      financial straits because of the budgetary cuts. Counties throughout Florida are continuously being asked to tighten their belts. That equates to a decrease in funding of $1000 per student next year, and a sharp decrease in necessary supplies for schools, teachers, and ultimately the students.
            %br
            %br
            Funding is important to the success of the public school system,                      academic achievement, and the retention of quality educators. Educators are the driving force of the school system and are constantly being asked to do more with less.
