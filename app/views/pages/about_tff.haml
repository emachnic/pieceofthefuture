        No one can deny that the public school systems in Florida are in dire financial straits
        because of the budget cuts. Counties throughout Florida are continuously being asked to
        tighten their belts. That equates to a decrease in funding of $1000 per student next year,
        and a sharp decrease in necessary supplies for schools, teachers, and ultimately the
        students.
      %p
        Funding is important to the success of the public school system, academic achievement,
        and the retention of quality educators. Educators are the driving force of the school
        system and are constantly being asked to do more with less.
